# 01_Step
This is the ***beta version*** of the **game**, in which you have to *make a choice*.
> As my friend said, "It's like flipping a coin!" It really looks like the truth ;)

The Game already has:
Classic game mode, three additional, but no less interesting game modes, help, settings, Easter eggs, achievements, statistics and good ASCII graphics!
Honestly, I tried.

The game hasn't been translated into English yet, sorry.
